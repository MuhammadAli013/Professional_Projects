# Anomaly Detection
This was one of my first projects back in early 2019. I used two methods, one was `OneClassSVM` and another one was `AnoGAN`. Here I will explain how both of them worked. <br>
*It's important to note that after 2019 a lot of good models were released related to Anomaly detection. So the techniques used in this projects are kind of old.*

# Demo Project
For NDA, I can not share actual project or actual project data. This is just a demo project similar to the original one with some random images from internet.

### data
Consider this dataset.
<------------- show some images about the dataset ---------------->
- good images
- anomaly images
- ratio
- supervised learning is not an option


### One Class SVM:
