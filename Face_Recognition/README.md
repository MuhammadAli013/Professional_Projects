# Face Recognition
We created a program to recognize known faces from images ( and videos ) and also it could identify faces that are not in the dataset. I will show you a demo project about this face recognition techniques.

## A demo project
it's important to note that for NDA, I can not share actual project or actual project data. This is just a demo project similar to the original one with some random images of me and my friends.

#### introduction
Say we have to create a program that can recognize 4 people. The names of those 4 people are `ali`, `shaan`, `tamim`, `amit`. I am using the names as labels here. Our program will be able to do one more very important thing:
 **it will identify all other persons as `unknown`**. 

 #### data preparation
