# 3D Object Classification and Segmentation
We did a lot of projects with 3D dataset. Most of them were related to `open3d`. Some of our tasks required 3D object classification and segmentation. Our default choice for these kind of projects were pointnet and pointnet++. 

## A demo project:
it's important to note that for NDA, I can not share actual project or actual project data. This is just a demo project similar to the original one with some random 3D objects from internet.

We have done two kind of projects. 
1. Classification
2. Segmentation

### Project 1: Classification
We were given some point clouds. Those point clouds were actually some chunks of a big point cloud scene. Our task was to find out if we have `object A` in that chunk. if we had `object A` in that point cloud, we considered that point cloud as our target point cloud. 

#### input data:
getting a proper demo input data is very hard.
