# projects
It will contain important project descriptions that I have done so far in different companies. 
Every name is self-explanatory. You can go through every project folder and you will understand the gist of what I did. 

As most of these projects are from my different companies, **I am not allowed to use any actual dataset**. 
So,
- In some cases, I used a similar public dataset for the explanation.
- In some cases, I had to use abstract visualizations for the explanation.
